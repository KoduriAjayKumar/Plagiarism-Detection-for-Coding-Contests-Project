# üìö Plagiarism Detection for Coding Contests

Detect and flag plagiarized code submissions during programming contests to ensure fairness and integrity.

---

## üö© Problem Statement
In programming contests, identifying plagiarism manually is a significant challenge. Participants often copy code, compromising the competition's integrity. This project automates plagiarism detection using web scraping, machine learning, and database management to streamline the process.

## üìñ Project Description
This project is designed to automatically detect and flag cases of code plagiarism in coding contests by:
- Scraping user submissions from HackerRank with **Selenium**.
- Storing submission data in a **MySQL database**.
- Using **Sentence Transformer** to compute similarities between codes.
- Displaying flagged submissions through a **Flask web application** for easy review.

## üõ†Ô∏è Inputs Required
To run this project, the following inputs are needed:

1. **HackerRank Login Credentials**: For scraping user submissions with `Selenium.py`.
2. **MySQL Database Details**: Host, user, password, and database name.
3. **Submission Data**: Gathered by running `Selenium.py` to populate the `CodeSubmissions` table.
4. **Model Threshold Value**: Set in `MLPlaglarismCheck.py` for similarity comparison (e.g., 0.98).

## üóÇÔ∏è Explanation of Code Files

### 1. `Selenium.py` - Web Scraping and Data Storage
**Purpose**: Automates the process of logging into HackerRank, navigating to the submissions page, and scraping relevant data to store in a MySQL database.

**Functionality**:
- **Login and Navigation**: Uses Selenium to log in and navigate to the contest submissions dashboard.
- **Data Extraction**: Extracts `username`, `problem title`, `language`, `time`, `score`, and `source code`.
- **Database Storage**: Inserts scraped data into the `CodeSubmissions` table in the MySQL database.

**Snippet**:
```python
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://www.hackerrank.com/auth/login/google")
# Automates the login and extraction process.
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO CodeSubmissions (username, problem_title, language, time, score, source_code) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)", data)
